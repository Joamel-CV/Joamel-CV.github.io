     <h1 class="title"> What is Forced Induction?</h1>
      <p class= "info"> Forced induction is a performance car term used to discribe a car part that forces air into the manifold creating more power. Car engine are driven by three main factor those are: Air, Fuel, and Spark. The more of those three factor you have inside the engine the more power you will produce. In Forced Induction there are two common parts know as Turbocharger and Supercharger. </p>
     <h1 class="title"> How does a Supercharger work?</h1>
        <p class="info"> Superchargers have one similiarity to turbochargers, and that is their purpose, they are use to forced more air into the engine making more power. The different between Turbos and Superchargers are the way that they are power driven, supercharger are not exhaust driven like their rival they are belt driven connecting them directly to the crankshaft. One of the advantage of supercharger are that they can force air at low RPM's meaning the moment your step on the gas pedal you will have instant boost. A disadvantage of a supercharger is that they generally make lesser boost than the turbo and are not built to run all the engine produce. Excluding the Centrifugal Supercharger, centrifugal supercharger also know as a procharger they look very similar to a turbo the main difference is that a turbo has a hot side turbine opposite of the cold side turbine and a procharger has a pulley where the hot side turbine is supposed to be. Procharger are also belt driven but the differece is that it also has lag at low RPM's but they generally make good boost on the mid range area of the engine RPM's.</p>

     <h1 class="title"> Turbocharger explained?</h1>
       <p class="info"> Turbos are a sort of forced induction that works best at high RPM's, They have two turbines know as cold side turbine and hot side turbine. The hot side turbine uses the exhaust gases produced by the engine to drive the cold side turbine by a shaft. The cold side turbine suck fresh air pressuring it and then forcing it down some turbo pipes into the engine manifold. One of the disadvantage of turbos is something know as turbo lag, that means that at low RPM you won't produce boost, that also mean that when you step on the gas pedal you will have to wait for boost to enter the manifold, because the turbo has to spool up to be able to create boost making more power.</p>

     <h1 class="title"> Differece between Turbocharger and Supercharger?</h1>
      <p class= "info"> To conclude we learned that both the Supercharger and the Turbocharger have their advantage and disadvantage, In term of the best choice that's going to depend on what you want if you want accelaration over top speed then go with the supercharger but if you want top speed then go with the turbo. If you wanna go completely overkill like me then I would recommend choosing the twincharged option that means using both the turbo and supercharger on the same engine.
